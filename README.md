# My SICP Notes and Solutions
=============================

Two years ago, I bought the book SICP. It was definitely a philosophy book in programming for me those times. I struggled a desperate battle to finish the problems in chapter1 at that time, which maked me so depressed because I met tons of difficulties. With the time passed by, I gave it up.

But after knowing something in compiling this term, I want to restart my SICP journey. And I think after the courses `Functional Programming` and `Numeric Analysis`, I can better handle the problems.
